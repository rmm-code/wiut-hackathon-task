Build a system that watches a fixed road camera, reports every traffic event it sees as a time segment with a class, and raises an alarm before an accident happens. You receive a few sample videos from the camera and no labels; we keep a hidden, annotated test set from the same camera and angle, and your solution runs offline on our machine against it.

Overview
The camera is a fixed CCTV view of a road (one angle, no camera motion). You receive a few sample videos from it and no labels. We keep a hidden test set of other videos from the same camera and angle, annotated by us. Your solution runs offline on our machine against that set.

The challenge has two parts:

Part A — Event detection (mandatory). Given an .mp4, return a list of events [start_sec, end_sec, label]. This is the core task.
Part B — Accident anticipation (bonus). Given frames one by one, return a risk score at every frame that an accident is about to start. Only past frames may be used.
A team submits three things:

A repository with code, model weights, and a one-command entry point that implements the interface in Output format & interface.
A public team website with the team, the approach, EDA of the sample videos, visualizations of your results, and a live demo where a visitor uploads a video and gets the events back, visualized.
A short technical report (a page on the website is fine): what you built, what worked, what did not.
We score the model on the hidden set with the published evaluate.py, then combine it with the website and code-quality scores (see Evaluation & scoring). Teams of three; one submission per team.

Part A — Traffic event detection
Given the path to one .mp4, return every traffic event in it as [start_sec, end_sec, label].

Input: a path to an .mp4 file from the camera. You may read the file any way you like (random access, multiple passes, clip sampling). Typical clips are several minutes long at 25 fps.
Output: a Python list of lists. start_sec and end_sec are floats in seconds from the first frame, 0 <= start_sec < end_sec <= duration. label is one of the official class ids from Event classes.
One event = one contiguous segment with one class. Two things happening at once are two separate entries. The same class can occur many times in a video; a video may contain no events at all (return []).
Segments of the same class must not overlap. Segments of different classes may overlap (a wrong_way vehicle causing an accident is two events).
Precision of boundaries matters: we match your segments to ours by temporal IoU, so an event you report as the whole minute around a 5-second crash does not count.
Any approach is allowed: a detector plus tracker with hand-written rules, a fine-tuned video model trained on public data, a vision-language model with open weights, or a mix. What we evaluate is the output list, not the method.

Part B — Accident anticipation (bonus)
At every frame, output the probability that an accident will start within the next 5 seconds, using only the frames seen so far.

Interface: a class RiskEstimator with reset(meta) and step(frame, t_sec) -> float. Our harness opens the video, calls reset once, then calls step for every frame in order and records the returned score. Your estimator never opens the video file itself; that is what makes the score causal.
Score: a float in [0, 1]. Higher means an accident is more likely to begin soon. The horizon is fixed: H = 5 s.
Frames: frame is a BGR uint8 array of shape (height, width, 3) (OpenCV convention); t_sec is the frame timestamp in seconds. meta gives fps, width, height, n_frames, video_id.
Speed: step is called for every frame, so keep it light. Skipping frames internally and returning the last score is fine. The time budget in Evaluation & scoring covers Part A and Part B together.
Part B is scored only against accident events. Other classes are ignored here.
Good anticipation signals do not need a trained accident model: time-to-collision between tracked vehicles, sudden braking, wrong-way or red-light trajectories, and pedestrians entering the roadway all raise the risk before the impact. A team that skips Part B simply leaves the default RiskEstimator in place and receives 0 for it.

Event classes
Use these 14 label ids exactly; all of them are official and any of them may appear in the hidden test set.

Label id	Event	Definition	Start	End
accident	Collision	Contact between two or more road users, or a road user and a fixed object	First frame where contact is visible	All involved objects stop moving or leave the frame
near_miss	Near miss	Sharp braking or swerving to avoid a collision; no contact	Onset of the evasive action	Road users are clear of each other
red_light	Red-light running	A vehicle crosses the stop line while its signal is red	Front of the vehicle crosses the stop line	Vehicle leaves the intersection or the frame
wrong_way	Wrong-way driving	A vehicle moves against the traffic direction of its lane, including driving in the oncoming lane	Vehicle enters the opposing lane	Vehicle returns to a correct lane or leaves the frame
illegal_u_turn	Illegal U-turn	A U-turn where the road markings or signs prohibit it	Vehicle starts turning	Vehicle completes the turn
stopped_vehicle	Stopped vehicle	A vehicle stationary on the carriageway for 10 s or more, not in a queue at a signal	Vehicle stops	Vehicle moves again or is removed
jaywalking	Pedestrian on roadway	A pedestrian on the carriageway outside a crossing	Pedestrian steps onto the road	Pedestrian leaves the road
failure_to_yield	Not yielding to a pedestrian	A vehicle drives through a crossing while a pedestrian is on it or stepping onto it	Vehicle enters the crossing	Vehicle leaves the crossing
illegal_turn	Illegal turn	A turn from the wrong lane or in a prohibited direction	Vehicle starts turning	Vehicle completes the turn
solid_line_crossing	Solid line crossing	A lane change or manoeuvre across a solid marking	Wheel crosses the line	Vehicle is fully in the new lane
stop_line	Stop-line violation	A vehicle stops past the stop line on red without entering the intersection	Vehicle stops	Signal turns green
congestion	Congestion	Traffic at a standstill or crawling across all lanes of a direction	Queue stops moving	Queue clears
road_obstacle	Obstacle on road	Debris, animal, or fallen object on the carriageway	Obstacle appears	Obstacle is removed
fire_smoke	Fire or smoke	Visible fire or smoke from a vehicle or on the road	First visible smoke	Smoke clears or the frame ends
Only classes that occur in the test set or in your predictions enter Score A. Speeding is not in the list: it cannot be measured from this camera without calibration.

The start and end columns are the conventions our annotators followed. When an event runs past the end of the video, end_sec equals the video duration.

Data
You receive sample videos from the camera and no labels; the test set is hidden and comes from the same camera and angle.

What you get

samples/*.mp4 — unlabeled clips from the camera (same resolution, frame rate, and viewpoint as the test set).
The starter kit: solution.py (the interface you implement), run_submission.py (the harness we run), evaluate.py (format check and the exact metric), plus an example ground_truth.json and predictions.json so you can see both formats.
What you do not get

Labels for the sample videos. You may annotate them yourselves to build a dev set; this is encouraged.
The test videos. They contain events that are not in the samples.
External data and models

Any public dataset may be used for training or pre-training (for example DoTA, CCD, DAD, CADP, UCF-Crime RoadAccidents, UA-DETRAC, BDD100K). List every dataset and its licence in your README.
Any open-weights model may be used (YOLO, RT-DETR, ByteTrack, video transformers, open VLMs such as Qwen-VL or InternVL). Closed models behind paid APIs are not allowed at any stage of inference. See Rules & constraints.
Output format & interface
Your repository must contain a solution.py at its root that exposes exactly this interface; our harness imports it and does the rest.

# solution.py
import numpy as np

CLASSES = ["accident", "near_miss", "red_light", "wrong_way", "illegal_u_turn",
           "stopped_vehicle", "jaywalking", "failure_to_yield", "illegal_turn",
           "solid_line_crossing", "stop_line", "congestion", "road_obstacle", "fire_smoke"]

def detect_events(video_path: str) -> list[list]:
    """Part A. Return [[start_sec, end_sec, label], ...] for one .mp4.
    start_sec, end_sec: float seconds from the first frame; label: one of CLASSES.
    """
    ...

class RiskEstimator:
    """Part B (optional). Causal: step() sees frames in order and nothing else."""
    def reset(self, meta: dict) -> None:
        # meta = {"video_id", "fps", "width", "height", "n_frames"}
        ...
    def step(self, frame: np.ndarray, t_sec: float) -> float:
        # frame: BGR uint8 (H, W, 3). Return P(accident starts within 5 s) in [0, 1].
        return 0.0
run_submission.py (from the starter kit, unchanged) walks a folder of videos, calls detect_events on each, streams every frame through RiskEstimator, and writes predictions.json:

{
  "team": "your-team-name",
  "videos": {
    "test_001.mp4": {
      "events": [[12.4, 18.9, "accident"], [40.0, 43.5, "red_light"]],
      "risk":   [[0.00, 0.01], [0.04, 0.01], [0.08, 0.02]]
    },
    "test_002.mp4": {"events": [], "risk": []}
  }
}
events is the list of lists from Part A. The harness drops any event with a label outside CLASSES, with start_sec >= end_sec, or overlapping an earlier segment of the same class, and lists every drop in its log; evaluate.py refuses a file that still contains one.
risk is one [t_sec, score] pair per frame, written by the harness from the values step returns. Teams that skip Part B get an all-zero curve.
Ground truth uses the same event shape, plus the duration: {"test_001.mp4": {"duration": 600.0, "fps": 25.0, "events": [[12.0, 19.0, "accident"]]}}.
Keys in videos are file names, not paths. Every test video must appear, even with an empty list.
A crash inside detect_events or step is caught by the harness, logged, and scored as an empty prediction for that video. Run python evaluate.py --pred predictions.json --validate-only before you submit; with your own labels, add --gt my_labels.json to get the score.

Evaluation & scoring
The model score is 70% event detection (macro F1 averaged over three temporal-IoU thresholds) and 30% accident anticipation; evaluate.py in the starter kit is the exact implementation.

Pipeline: your repo and weights → run_submission.py on our GPU, offline → predictions.json → evaluate.py (format check + hidden ground_truth.json) → Score A, Score B, model score. We run the same pipeline you can run locally; only the ground truth differs.

Part A — event detection

For each class c and each threshold τ ∈ {0.3, 0.5, 0.7}, compute the temporal IoU between every ground-truth segment and every predicted segment of class c in the same video.
Match greedily: sort all pairs by IoU, descending; a pair is matched if both segments are still unmatched and IoU ≥ τ. Matched = TP; unmatched predictions = FP; unmatched ground truth = FN.
Pool TP, FP, FN over all test videos, then compute F1_c(τ).
Score_A = mean over classes c in C of ( mean over τ in {0.3, 0.5, 0.7} of F1_c(τ) )

C is the set of official classes present in the test set. A class you predict that never occurs scores 0 for that class and is added to C. Micro F1, class-agnostic F1 (labels ignored), and a per-class table are reported for diagnostics but do not enter the score.

Part B — accident anticipation (accident events only; H = 5 s, W = 10 s, θ = 0.5)

Frame labels. A frame at time t is positive if an accident starts at s with s − H ≤ t < s. Frames inside any accident [s, e], and frames within [s − H, e] of a near_miss, are ignored. All other frames are negative.
AP. Average precision of the risk score over labelled frames, pooled across videos, then chance-normalised: AP = max(0, (AP_raw − r) / (1 − r)) where r is the positive rate. A constant or random score gets 0; a perfect ranking gets 1.
Alarms. An alarm is a maximal run of frames with score ≥ θ; runs separated by less than 2 s are merged. An alarm whose start lies in [s − W, s) of a still-unmatched accident matches it (earliest alarm wins). Alarms starting inside ignored frames are discarded. Precision = matched alarms / all alarms; recall = matched accidents / all accidents; F1_alarm from these.
Time-to-accident. For each accident, TTA = s − (start of its matched alarm), or 0 if unmatched; mTTA is the mean over all accidents.
Score_B = 0.4 × AP + 0.4 × F1_alarm + 0.2 × (mTTA / W)

A constant score of 1.0 gives one alarm at t = 0, near-zero precision, and a chance-level AP, so it scores 0.

Model score and elimination score

M = 0.7 × Score_A + 0.3 × Score_B

Elimination = 0.6 × M + 0.25 × Website + 0.15 × Code

Website and Code are judge scores in [0, 1] from the rubrics in Team website and Submission package. All scores are published per team after the elimination round.

Hardware and limits

Item	Limit
Machine	1 × NVIDIA GPU, 16 GB VRAM (T4-class), 8 CPU cores, 32 GB RAM — organizers may update this before the deadline
Internet during evaluation	None. All weights must be inside the package or in an archive we download before the run
Time per video (Part A + Part B)	At most 3 × the video duration in wall-clock time; over the limit, that video scores as empty
Weights	5 GB total
Python	3.10 or newer; dependencies from your requirements.txt (or a Dockerfile)
Team website
Publish a public website that presents the team, explains the solution, shows your visualizations of the sample videos, and lets a visitor upload a video and get the detected events back, visualized.

Build it however you like: vibe-code it with any LLM, any framework, any host (Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages, Hugging Face Spaces, Streamlit, your own server). There is no limit on scope. The more you build and the more initiative you show, the higher the score. It must stay online through the judging period.

Required pages or sections

Team. Members, roles, who did what, links to GitHub, LinkedIn, and personal portfolios; previous projects you are proud of.
Problem and approach. The pipeline as a diagram, the models and data you used, and why. Say what is learned and what is rule-based.
EDA of the sample videos. Resolution, fps, duration, lighting; object counts over time by class; motion heatmaps; vehicle trajectories and lane directions; traffic density by time; anything else you found.
Results on the sample videos. Your annotated versions of every sample video we gave you (rendered with your own tooling), the event timeline for each, the risk curve if you did Part B, examples of each class you detect, and honest failure cases.
Live demo. A visitor uploads an .mp4, your model runs on it, and the page returns the events and a visualization: a timeline, an annotated playback or clips, and the risk curve. State the size and length you accept (2 minutes is enough) and show progress while it runs. CPU inference is fine for the demo.
Report. What worked, what did not, what you would do next. One page.
Links. Repository, weights, predictions_samples.json.
Ideas that earn extra credit

Interactive charts instead of static images; click an event on the timeline to jump the video to it.
Ablations: detector A vs B, with and without tracking, different frame rates, with the numbers.
Error analysis on your own dev labels of the sample videos; confusion between classes.
A dashboard view: events per hour, per lane, per class, as an operator would see it.
Running the demo on a live stream or a webcam.
Anything else you think an organizer or a city traffic centre would want to see.

Criterion	Weight	What earns full marks
Runs as submitted	40%	Both commands work on a clean machine; no manual steps
Reproducibility	25%	Weights, seeds, datasets, and training scripts are present; results on the samples match predictions_samples.json
Structure and readability	20%	Clear modules, no dead code, no notebooks as the only source

A package that does not run after one attempt to fix an obvious environment issue receives a model score of 0.

Rules & constraints
Open weights only, no paid APIs, everything reproducible from the repository; breaking a rule disqualifies the team from the elimination round.

Models. Only models whose weights you can ship in the package. No calls to OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic, or any other hosted model during inference. Using such tools to write code, the website, or the report is allowed and expected.
Data. Public datasets and your own annotations of the sample videos are allowed. Do not scrape or collect footage from the same camera by other means; if you find it, do not use it.
Interface. run_submission.py and evaluate.py are used unchanged. RiskEstimator.step uses only the frames it has received; reading the video file inside it, or reusing Part A output that was computed with future frames, is a violation.
Determinism. Fix seeds. Two runs on the same machine must give the same predictions.json up to floating-point noise.
Originality. Reuse of open-source code is fine with attribution in the README. Submitting another team’s solution, or a shared solution across teams, is not.
One submission per team. The tagged commit at the deadline is what we run. Later commits are ignored.
Website content. Only your own material or content you have the rights to. No personal data of people visible in the footage beyond what the video itself shows.
Starter kit, tips, and FAQ
The starter kit is three files: the interface you implement, the harness we run, and the exact metric with its format check.

File	What it does
solution.py	Template with the 14 CLASSES, detect_events, RiskEstimator; the default returns no events and zero risk
run_submission.py	Runs your solution.py over a folder of videos, enforces the time budget, drops malformed events, writes predictions.json
evaluate.py	Checks the format (--validate-only) and computes Score A, Score B, and the model score from predictions.json and a ground_truth.json
examples/	A ground_truth.json and a predictions.json in the exact format
Tips

Annotate the sample videos yourselves with the conventions in Event classes and run evaluate.py against your own labels. Without a dev set you are guessing.
Boundaries matter more than you think: post-process segments (merge fragments, drop sub-second blips) and check the effect at IoU 0.7.
For Part B, a time-to-collision estimate from tracks is a strong, simple risk signal; calibrate it so 0.5 means “probably within 5 s”.
Measure runtime early. Sampling every second or third frame is usually enough for the rules and keeps you far inside the budget.
FAQ

Can we change CLASSES? Only by removing classes you never predict. Do not add ids.
Do events need to be sorted? No. Overlaps within one class are dropped by the harness (the earlier-starting segment is kept).
What if two events of the same class happen at once? Report them as one segment covering both. Our annotations do the same.
Can Part A use Part B’s risk curve? Yes. The reverse is not allowed.
Is a Docker image accepted instead of requirements.txt? Yes, with a Dockerfile in the repository root and the same two commands inside the container.
Where do we ask questions? In the hackathon Telegram group; answers that change the rules are posted to everyone and added here.
